<p>VR View is a name that has been used for many projects over the years.
  <a href="http://vrview.com/">Here</a> is a project by Axis Images that is over 20 years old and uses Apple's Quicktime.</p>

<p>The VR View project on this site was originally started in late 2015. It had some really cool features and I intend to eventually bring this project back here.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2016 Google started using the name for its <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview">product/technology</a>
  used to embed immersive 360 and 3D content.  The web version this project was created primarily by <a href="https://github.com/borismus">Boris Smus</a>.
  It uses the <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> 3D library, which uses <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a>.</p>

  <p>For now I am using this url to help out with the Google/Boris Smus version.
    I also have here an extra customized version which includes a server, some video player updates, and an experimental connect mode that allows the viewing of 3D 360 content with an inexpensive cell phone.</p>

<p>Extra customized version:</p>
